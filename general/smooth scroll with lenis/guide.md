# Smooth Scroll with Lenis

## Purpose

Implement smooth scrolling functionality using the Lenis library. It provides a pleasant scrolling experience with adjustable settings, including duration, easing, direction, and touch sensitivity.

## How It Works

The script includes the Lenis library hosted from a Webflow URL and a custom `scroll` class that extends the Lenis class. The class is configured with various options for smooth scrolling, and additional functionalities are added for handling scrolling controls, stopping/starting, and toggling page scrolling. The script also includes a mechanism to handle the Webflow editor view.

## Potential Modifications

- Adjust the configuration settings inside the `scroll` class constructor to customize the smooth scrolling behavior.
- Explore and modify the additional functionalities for handling scroll controls, stopping/starting, and toggling page scrolling based on your specific requirements.

## Implementation in Webflow

1. Open your Webflow project.
2. Add an Embed element to the page(s) where you want to enable smooth scrolling.
3. Paste the provided script into the Embed element's code section.
4. Save the changes, and republish your site.

Now, your website will have smooth scrolling functionality with the specified configurations. Customize the script as needed for your project.
